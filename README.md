# Healthy-India-SIH
Healthy-India-SIH is a healthcare-focused project built for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH). The goal of this repository is to create a unified digital platform that helps citizens access, manage, and track their health-related cards and services. Features include:

->Dashboard to view health card details and coverage

->Nearby hospital/clinic discovery where cards are valid

->Easy health record management and status tracking

->User-friendly interface for quick access to government healthcare schemes

This project aims to bridge the gap between citizens and healthcare services, making Indiaâ€™s healthcare ecosystem more accessible and transparent.
